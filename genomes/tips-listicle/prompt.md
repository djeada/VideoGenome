# Authoring prompt: vertical tips listicle

Build a vertical listicle scene: a hook, 3-5 numbered tips and a call to action.
Each card holds long enough to read (about 15 characters per second), numbers
work as kickers, and the backdrop moves continuously behind every card so the
cuts feel like one piece. Keep copy inside the platform-safe zone. Consider a
progress indicator that fills per tip, and an emphasis colour for one key word
per tip chosen by contrast.

**House rules.** `"timing": "clock"` with the `vg-scene` toolkit (`videogenome recipe-new`);
every on-screen string is a bounded param drawn with `fillText` and fitted with
`vg.fit` (throw when it cannot fit); ink chosen with `vg.readable`; layout from
`W`, `H` and `unit` so 16:9, 9:16 and 1:1 work, with copy kept out of the top 12%
and bottom 22% in 9:16; seeded randomness only; no network; at least three
finished presets. Facts a writer could invent (names, numbers, dates, quotes)
become `fill: "verbatim"` template slots.

**Checks.** Render each preset at 1080x1920 and 1920x1080, build contact sheets
every 1-1.5 s and look at them; wire a template with sound cued to the beats;
confirm the loudness, true-peak and no-dead-picture gates pass; fill it from two
briefs with a small local writer.
