# Authoring prompt: product turntable from your 3d model

Build a product turntable: the supplied model rotates once on a clean studio
set, framed so the silhouette reads, followed by the product name and a call to
action. Lighting should flatter the form (key, rim, soft floor reflection). The
product name must be copied from the brief and the template must not claim the
render is a photograph.

**House rules.** `"timing": "clock"` with the `vg-scene` toolkit (`videogenome recipe-new`);
every on-screen string is a bounded param drawn with `fillText` and fitted with
`vg.fit` (throw when it cannot fit); ink chosen with `vg.readable`; layout from
`W`, `H` and `unit` so 16:9, 9:16 and 1:1 work, with copy kept out of the top 12%
and bottom 22% in 9:16; seeded randomness only; no network; at least three
finished presets. Facts a writer could invent (names, numbers, dates, quotes)
become `fill: "verbatim"` template slots.

**Checks.** Render each preset at 1080x1920 and 1920x1080, build contact sheets
every 1-1.5 s and look at them; wire a template with sound cued to the beats;
confirm the loudness, true-peak and no-dead-picture gates pass; fill it from two
briefs with a small local writer.
